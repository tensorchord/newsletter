# Newsletter

## Introduction

`envd` newsletter is a **community driven** project aimed for gathering MLOps or AI/ML **engineering** fans together and building a neighborhood for them. 
We covered the following topics:

- Highlights in Machine Learning, Data Science engineering 
- Trending news of MLOps and changes of [envd](https://github.com/tensorchord/envd)
- Guides for students/researchers/beginners for accelerating their research speed

Other than others AI/ML newsletters, we care more about engineering than research.

If you want to turn an exciting algorithm to be a popular stable service. You're in the right place!

## Schedule

We release issues on 15th and 30th of every month. Here is the chart of our issues:

| Date  | Link  |  Editor |

## section

Here are four sections
- MLOps Radar: trending news in MLOps
- Highlights: progress/improvements worth watching in the recent days in AI/ML especially the engineering part.
- Camping: guides/tutorials help people quickly solve a problem, enjoy a new tech or know something interesting in machine learning, data science or related topics.
- `envd` again: anything about `envd` here.

## How to submit

- You can submit at any time and it will release in the next issue when it is approved by editor.
- You don't need to care about which section your articles belongs to, editors will help you.
